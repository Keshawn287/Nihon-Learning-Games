# 🇯🇵 Nihon-Learning-Games

This project will be a collection of Japanese learning games and quizzes designed to help users master basic numbers and beginner-level vocabulary. It will include matching games, quizzes, and memory-style challenges to create an engaging and interactive learning experience.

This is a **self-practice exercise** Built using React, along with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, the project strengthens front-end development skills — including component-based architecture, state management, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI updates — while reinforcing essential Japanese language fundamentals.
